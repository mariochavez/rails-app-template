# Your Rails Application Name

## Introduction

Welcome to **Your Rails Application Name**! This is a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) application designed to [briefly describe the purpose or goal of your application].

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (>= <%= ruby_version %>)
- [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#installing-rails) (>= <%= rails_version %>)
<%= "- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)" if sqlite %> 
<%= "- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download.html)" if postgresql %> 

### Assumptions

This application was setup with few configuration assumptions.

- ActiveStorage was setup and ready to use.
    - S3 AWS gem was added but only for production.
    - Configure `config/storage.yml` properly.
    - Review `config/application.rb` for ActiveStorage proxy if need it.
- ActionText was setup and ready to be use.
- [ActionPolicy](https://actionpolicy.evilmartians.io/) was setup and ready to be use.
<%= "- [Litestack](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack) was setup. Review additional configuration options." if sqlite %>
- [LetterOpener](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener) was setup for development.
- Brakeman, Bundle Audit, and Standard were added for development. Also, `.solargraph.yml` configuration file along, `.rubocop.yml`, and `.standard.yml`.
- [Lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge) was added and setup for production.
- [Rails I18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n) gem was added, review configuration at `config/application.rb`
- [Meta Tags](https://github.com/kpumuk/meta-tags) gem was added, review `config/initializers/meta_tags.rb` configuration, and set your own meta tags.
<%= "- [tailwindcss-rails](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails) was added, it was setup with a default color scheme that can be used with `*-skin-{key}`, the keys and colors are defined at `app/assets/stylesheets/config.css` file." if tailwindcss %>
- [Solid Queue](https://github.com/basecamp/solid_queue) gem was added and setup for production and development.
  - When database is SQLite3, then a second database is setup for the queue (queue database), from now on you need to generate migrations with key `--database primary` and execute db commands with `:primary` append, example: `bin/rails db:migrate:primary`.
  - [Mission Control-Jobs](https://github.com/basecamp/mission_control-jobs) was setup, review documentation to secure the `/jobs` endpoint.
- Rack Attack was setup an ready to use. Review Rack Attack's initializer for additional configuration.

### Recommendations

#### Production

```bash
bin/rails credentials:edit
```

#### Development

```bash
bin/rails credentials:edit --environment=development
```

#### Test

```bash
bin/rails credentials:edit --environment=test
```

### Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your-rails-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash

    ```

3. Install dependencies and setup the database:

    ```bash
    bin/setup
    ```
